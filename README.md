# Plant Identifier App 🌱

**Authors:** Yashmit Bhaverisetti & Manvika Kanukuntla  
**Project Type:** CSE Pathway Capstone Project


## Project Overview

The **Plant Identifier App** is a mobile application built using **React Native** and **Expo** that allows users to identify plants in real-time using their device's camera. By capturing an image, the app connects to the **Kindwise Plant Identification API** to provide detailed information about the plant, including:

- Common names  
- Scientific taxonomy  
- Probability of identification  
- Description from Wikipedia  
- Reference links for more information  

This project was developed as part of the **CSE Pathway Capstone Project** to demonstrate skills in **mobile app development, API integration, asynchronous data handling, and user experience design**.
